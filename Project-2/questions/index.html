        <h3>
            <li>What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?</li>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>External CSS has a separate file which is linked in the head of HTML document.</li>
            <li>Internal CSS is declared inside &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; element, in the head of HTML document.</li>
            <li>Inline CSS is declared inside an element as an attribute where style is the attribute and properties
                plus their values are the attribute value.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <li>What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?</li>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Syntax for class selectors: .class</li>
            <li>Syntax for ID selectors: #idName</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            <li>How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>selector1, selector2 {property:value;}</p>
        <h3>
            <li>Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a
                single rule?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>#title.primary{property:value;}</p>
        <h3>
            <li>What does the descendant combinator do?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>The descendant combinator is represented by a single space between selectors and has effect on the last
            selector only if it's nested inside of ancestor.</p>
        <h3>
            <li>Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has
                the higher specificity?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>The rule which includes the class.</p>
        <h3>
            <li>From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?</li>
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Content</li>
            <li>Padding</li>
            <li>Border</li>
            <li>Margin</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>
            <li>What does the box-sizing CSS property do?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>Box-sizing property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated. It can have the value
            content-box which gives the default CSS box-sizing behavior or it can have the value border-box which makes
            the value of the border and padding to shrink to the element width and height.</p>
        <h3>
            <li>What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?</li>
        </h3>
        <p> <strong>The standard box model</strong> is represented by the given dimensions to the content box and if
            there will be specified a
            size for padding or border, that size will be added to the size of the content box.<br>
            <strong>The alternative box model</strong> is represented by the box that is seen on the screen, this means
            that the size of the padding and border will be included in the size of the content box.
        </p>
        <h3>
            <li>Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 2 elements?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>I would use margins as this is placed in the extremity of the box.</p>
        <h3>
            <li>Would you use margin or padding to create more space between the contents of an element and its border?
            </li>
        </h3>
        <p>I would use padding because this property is placed between content box and border.</p>
        <h3>
            <li>Would you use margin or padding if you wanted two elements to overlap each other?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>I would use margin.</p>
        <h3>
            <li>What is the difference between a block element and an inline element?</li>
        </h3>
        <p><strong>A block element</strong> is placed on a single line, below and above other block element.<br>
            <strong>An inline element</strong> can be places beside another element.
        </p>
        <h3>
            <li>What is the difference between an inline element and an inline-block element?</li>
        </h3>
        <p><strong>Inline elements</strong> have width and height ignored.<br>
            <strong>Inline-block elements</strong> behave like an inline element with width, height, margins and
            paddings are respected.
        </p>

        </h3>
        <p><strong>A flex container</strong> is an element that has the property display:flex.<br>
            <strong>A flex item</strong> is any element located inside the flex container.
        </p>
        <h3>
            <li>How do you create a flex item?</li>
        </h3>
        <p>A flex item can be created in the same way as the flex container, that means it can be both flex item or flex
            container.</p>
        <h3>
            <li>What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand flex property?</li>
        </h3>

        </h3>
        <p>By defining the following properties to the container: justify-content:center and align-items: center.</p>
        <h3>
            <li>What’s the difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around?</li>
        </h3>
        <p><strong>justify-content: space-between</strong> is taking into account only the space between elements, not the
            space between the extremities.<br>
            <strong>justify-content: space-around</strong> is assigning an equal space between the elements and also
            between extremities.
